# Help Center React App

This project is a React-based frontend application designed to interact with the Help Center API. It allows users to view, create, and manage "Help Center" cards.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository and change the directories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vivekdokku/Help-Center-API-Assignment.git
cd Frontend
cd my-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `my-app` directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
```


### 3. Running the App

Start the React development server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This should automatically open the app in your default web browser. If it doesn’t, you can manually visit `http://localhost:3000`.

You should see the React app running, interacting with the backend API.
